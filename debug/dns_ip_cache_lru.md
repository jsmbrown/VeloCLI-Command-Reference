#	--dns_ip_cache_lru [v4 | v6 | all]

##	Description
Displays the contents of the DNS IP address cache, which stores recently resolved domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. The cache follows a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy, meaning that when the cache is full, the oldest, least accessed entries are removed to make space for new ones. This command helps in troubleshooting DNS resolution issues by showing what names the VeloCloud Edge has resolved and cached.

##  Arguments (optional)
| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| v4 | Displays only IPv4 DNS cache entries. |
| v6 | Displays only IPv6 DNS cache entries. |
| all | Displays all DNS cache entries (both IPv4 and IPv6). This is the default if no argument is specified. |
